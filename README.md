# Algorithms  

Here I am going to post Python implementation of some algorithms that are being discussed in the on-line Stanford course called "Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1". 

## Week 1

Week 1 discusses the basics of the divide-and-conquer approach, as well as how to apply O ("big-oh") notation to make a crude estimation of algorithms performance. Two examples the are implemented here are the Merge Sort algorithm and its extension that calculates the number of inversions required to perform a sorting procedure. 

Following the lecture notes I have implemented two algorithms: 
1. Merge-sort (1- and n-dimentional) 
2. Merge-sort with counting inversions. 
3. Finding the closest pair of points (brute force and divide-and-conquer approaches).
